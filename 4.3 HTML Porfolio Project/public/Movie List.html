<h1>Alex's Movie Rankings</h1>
<h2>Top Three of All Time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is best for a lot of different things but mostly the animation was amazing</p>
<br> 
<h3>2 Fast 2 Furious</h3>
<p>Mostly nostalgia, but nothing beats 2000's car culture</p>
<br>
<h3>Ocean's 11</h3>
<p>One of the best if not the best heist films of all time.</p>
